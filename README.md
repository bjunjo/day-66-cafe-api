## Solution
- Read the final API docs here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/162180/UVJWqzfg
## Lessons
- GET: Get something from the server
- POST: Post something to the server
- PATCH vs PUT
  - PATCH: Fixing a specific part of a request e.g. the front tire of a bicycle
  - PUT: Fixing the entire part of a request e.g. the whole bicylce
- DELETE; Delete something in the server
